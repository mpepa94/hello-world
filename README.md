Hello all!

My name is Mitch Pepa and I am a student (soon to be graduate) of the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana.
I've been coding for several years now and have the most experience in the C languages, but have also done a lot of work in and outside classes in several other languages. I feel that one of my greatest strengths is that I can pick up new programming languages very quickly. 
I will be graduating in December of 2017 and look forward to getting a job where I can use my programming skills in the real world.
